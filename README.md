Is It Raining is a weather app designed for users 10+ with specs to fit the iPhone SE mobile phone. The app takes the user's geolocation and displays accurate weather information based on the longitude and latitude. Along with accurate weather information, the background and animal display change depending on the current weather condition at your location. All of the animals are collectible and once you collect 10 of an animal, which is displayed in the Animal Inventory, you can level it up! This function is to encourage retention and use of the app. 
I tested the UX experience on my 12 year old sister and her friends, from ages 10 to 14, where I watched them interact with the app without instruction and made adjustments to the design based on their reactions and questions. A team of two back end developers and two front end, myself included, took this app from ideation to completion in one short month. In the planning phase we made detailed user flow diagrams then turned the flow into deliverables with Trello to keep track of our progress, and implemented an agile workflow to ensure we always moved forward with the app.
